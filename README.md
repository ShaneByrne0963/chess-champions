# Chess Champions

## Introduction

Chess Champions is a website where the user can play a game of chess the way they want against a friend or a computer of varying levels of difficulty. The aim of the site is to entertain the user with a game that is over 1500 years old.

The website is deployed to Github Pages and can be found here: <https://shanebyrne0963.github.io/chess-champions/>

## UI/UX Design

### Color Scheme

- The website has a simple and uniform color scheme, with all text colored white displayed on a brown shaded background
- The brown color is designed to resemble the outside chessboard, and gives the website a wood-like asthetic
- Some areas of the website have different shades of brown to add color diversity to the page

### Typography

- The website uses a single font, Roboto Slab, for its headings and normal text
- The use of a single font is to maintain font style consistency across the site
- This font was used because it is an easy to read serif font, with a style that represents the old-fashioned nature of the game well
